To run the bootsvc integration tests, boot with these boot cmdline arguments:
`userboot=bin/bootsvc bootsvc.next=bin/bootsvc-tests`.  This will tell bootsvc
to execute its test suite instead of the usual boot chain.  The expected output
from a boot in this mode is a unittest suite report that says 0 failed tests.
